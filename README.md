# Bakery: A recipe website powered by Notion

With Bakery, I want to provide public access to my Notion recipe database. This project is an Angular app with a clean UI and will fetch recipe data from my Notion database via the official API. The backend will run serverless, via Netlify Functions.

Mockup of the UI:
